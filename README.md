## Usage
Want to hit the gym but don't want to go alone? Or lacking the motivation to get yourself to the gym regularly? DFT is here to help you find your workout buddy!

With our app, you can connect with a workout buddy in your local area, someone who goes to the same gym as you, or someone interested in the same type of workout.

For first-time users, join DFT to start your workout journey by clicking the 'Sign Up' button. Provide the required information to set up an account and click "Sign Up!" Next, you'll be asked to provide information to help potential workout buddies find you. Hit the "Create Profile!" button, and you're all set. Start reaching out to people you're interested in becoming workout buddies with today!

For returning users, find a new workout buddy by signing in. Update the information on your profile page to reflect the city you're currently in, the gym you'll be going to today, and/or the workout you would like to do. After updating the information, return to the workout party by clicking on the 'Posting' tab.
