## Usage
Wanting to hit the gym but don't want to go alone? or lack of motivation to get yourself to the gym regularly? DFT is here to help you to find your workout buddy!

Using our app, you can find your workout buddy that lives in your local area, goes to the same gym as you do, or wants to do the same type of workout as you do.

For first-time users, join DFT to start your workout journey by clicking the 'Sign Up' button. Provide the required information to set up an account and click "Sign Up!". Next, you'll be asked to provide information to help potential workout buddies find you. Hit the "Create Profile!" button and you are all set. Start reaching out to the people that you are interested in becoming workout buddies with today!

For returning users, find a new workout buddy by first signing in. Update the information on your profile page to reflect the city you're currently in, the gym you'll be going to today, and/or the workout you would like to do. After updating the information, return to the workout party by clicking on the 'Posting' tab.
